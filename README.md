git clone https://github.com/Rudra0075-ms/Student_Management_System.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project

```bash
cd Student_Management_System
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Apply migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create an admin account

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Start the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## 🗄️ Database

The project currently uses **SQLite** for data storage.

Student information is managed through Django models and Django's ORM, allowing the application to perform:

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete
* Search
* Sort
* Filter

operations without writing raw SQL for normal database operations.

---

## 🔎 Student Search & Management

The system allows users to quickly find and manage student records.

Example workflow:

```text
Dashboard
   ↓
Student List
   ↓
Search / Sort
   ↓
View Student
   ├── Edit
   └── Delete
```

Pagination keeps the student list manageable when the number of records increases.

---

## 📊 Dashboard

The dashboard acts as the central management page where users can access student information and navigate between the major features of the application.

---

## 🔐 Security

The project takes advantage of Django's built-in security mechanisms, including:

* CSRF protection
* Authentication middleware
* Password hashing
* Session management
* Form validation
* Django ORM protection against common SQL injection patterns

For production deployment, sensitive configuration such as `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, and API keys should be stored using **environment variables** rather than committed to GitHub.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is deployed online and can be accessed here:

### 🌐 [Open Student Management System](https://student-management-app-2026.netlify.app/)

> **Note:** Django is primarily a server-side framework. A production Django application normally requires a Python-capable backend host such as Render, Railway, PythonAnywhere, AWS, etc. Netlify is primarily designed for static sites/serverless workloads, so Django deployment on Netlify requires an appropriate serverless/backend configuration.

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

The current system can be extended with more production-level functionality:

* 📸 Student profile pictures
* 📧 Email notifications
* 📄 Export students to CSV/PDF
* 📊 Advanced analytics
* 🔍 Advanced filtering
* 👥 Role-based access control
* 👨‍🏫 Teacher management
* 📚 Course management
* 🎓 Attendance management
* 📝 Marks and grade management
* 🔔 Notification system
* 🌐 REST API using Django REST Framework
* 🐘 PostgreSQL for production database
* 🐳 Docker support
* 🔄 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
* ☁️ Production deployment
